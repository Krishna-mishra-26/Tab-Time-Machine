# Tab-Time-Machine
Tab Time Machine is a Chrome extension designed to enhance productivity by allowing users to save, organize, and restore browser tabs with ease. It acts as a time capsule for your browsing sessions, letting you travel back in time and revisit tabs from previous days or restore tabs you may have accidentally closed
